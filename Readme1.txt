Hello,

Unfortunately due to confidentiality agreements I am quite limited on what I can show, so I made a beta form of each.

The excel sheet title as "RR Report 3.0" wont allow you to store the data, however i added a snippet from our older database I created. When loading the data please use the txt file included in this folder!

The second excel sheet is used by the technicans that help relay tool health by generating an email and saving to appropriate locations, as well as storing necessary data fields. The picture found in this folder contains the Outlook email.

The third example I have is my progress as begin to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently I am working my way into JavaScript, so this example is exclusively only front end. 

Thanks!
Dennys
